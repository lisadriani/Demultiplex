Open the four fastq files and read each simultaenously 
    for each nth record of each file--> each file has an array size of 4 for each line #take each /record/ at a time 
        for just the phred score line:
            check that phred score for each position in index 1 and index 2 are <30  
                if yes: write to r1 and r2 unknown files with edited headers 
                    edited headers = index1_revcomp(index2) 
                    unknown_count+=1 
        for just the sequence line: 
            check index 1 in set? 
                if not: send to unknown 
                    edited headers = index1_revcomp(index2)

Functions: 

def revcomp(seq: str): 
    ```takes a sequence string and returns the reverse complement``` 
    return revcomp(seq)

Test example: revcomp(AAACCCTTTGGG) = CCCAAAGGGTTT

def convert_phred(letter: str) -> int:
    ```Converts a single character into a phred score```
    return (ord(letter)) - 33

Test example: convert_phred(E) = 36
