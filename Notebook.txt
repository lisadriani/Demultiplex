Got the assignment.
notes from explanation: 
	Multiplexing: pooling samples together and sequencing them together
	To separate them back out: Code. Bioinformatically 
	Attaching a known barcode so that we can resort them 
	Assignment the first: pseudocode
	Develop strategy to create 48 fastq files that create acceptable pairs, 2 index hopped reads-pairs, two fat1 files with nonmatching or low quality index pairs
	Barcodes on either side of the inserts are the same 
	Text file on Talapas 
	



	cd /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing
	4 histograms: 
	X is the position (0 to {read length}
	Y is the mean Q score (0 – 40/41)
	What do the reads mean biologically vs downstream analysis and how that affects which quality score you want to use
	Next question: how many N base calls are there? Challenge: use a one line command

363,246,735 records in the file 1 
How many sequences in the line?
Head – 2 | tail -1 | wc   and then -1 for the new line character 

Read the read me

Part 2: 
Write a strategy not a script! 

4 fastq files: 
1 biological: read 1
2 index: index 1
3 index: index 2
4 biological : read 2


The first reads in each file are from the same cluster in the flowcell 
XY position for first one is 1265:1191 
You have to parse all of the files at the same time
Look at the indexes, if they’re the same, output the indexes and reads to each of those files


Index4_R1.fq 
Index4_R2.fq 
Index6_R1.fq
Index6_R2.fq

2 fastq files for non matching reads
So: index4 on read 1 and index 5 on read 2, probably index hopping put those reads into the hopped files
2 additional fastq files for index reads that don’t match known indexes or read quality is low so we don’t trust it 
52 files all together! 
Add indexes to the end of the headers. 
Were there indexes that hopped more often than others?
Reverse complement function! 

Part 1: 

srun --account=bgmp --partition=bgmp --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=1 --time=00:40:00 --cpus-per-task=1 --pty bash

Illumina's fastq header: 
@<instrument>:<run number>:<flowcell ID>:<lane>:<tile>:<x-pos>:<y-pos>:<UMI> <read>:<is filtered>:<control number>:<index>

To try and determine which file is the index vs the read I first did 
ls -lah and found that the R2 and R3 are much much smaller than R1 and R4. 
After 
zcat <file> | head

Its clear that R1 and R4 are read 1 and read 2. R2 and R3 are index 1 and index 2. 


To find the read lengths: 

$ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 | wc 
      1       1     102
$ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 | wc 
      1       1       9
$ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 | wc 
      1       1       9
$ zcat 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 | wc 
      1       1     102

and subtract 1 for the newline character. 


To try and find the Phred score, I searched for [a-z]+ with grep so that if there were any lowercase letters, I would know its 
Phred 64. if there are no small letters, then its Phred 33. 
so I tried :cat 1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '4~4p' | grep -E "[a-z]+" | head
but that took forever. 
Found that # is only in phred 33 and we definitely see # in the quality scores for these samples, so the phred encoding is 33





To find mean of all qscores: 

get_hist.py 


activated bgmp_py310 and downloaded numpy and matplotlib

working through issues. Ran with out a list of lists
The outputs ending with 5*.out are because I tried to sbatch a python script lol 
learning every day 
get_hist.21723534.out
get_hist.21723552.out
get_hist.21723554.out

get_hist.21723616.out bc i forgot back slashes in command. 
get_hist.21723626.out for misspelled conda activate
get_hist.21723630.out for missing / before usr bin time
HAD A TON OF OUTPUT FILES that couldn't run it because I forgot ./ whoops
Changed the output name to 
"read1_hist.%j.out" so that it would be renamed 


21723943      bgmp  sget.sh ladriani  R       0:28      1 n279
21723929      bgmp  sget.sh ladriani  R       4:35      1 n279
21723929 is running read 1
21723943 is running index 1 
currenlty testing to see how long it may take 

Tried running them with my data from PS9. It ended up doing this: 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/gpfs/projects/bgmp/ladriani/bioinfo/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-first/./get_hist.py", line 24, in <module>

For both the index1 and read 1 this happened. I changed the script to pull fully from PS4 instead. PS9 information is all hashed out but still in get_hist.py
index1_hist.21723943.out 
read1_hist.21723929.out 
These are related to the PS9 script, not the PS4 script. 


Trying it again with the PS4 script! 
index1_hist.21723943.out
index2_hist.21725470.out
read1_hist.21725473.out
read2_hist.21725475.out

have an hour time limit. may have to restart without time limits....
canceled read1_hist.21725473.out and read2_hist.21725475.out and started them without time limits:

read1_hist.21725505.out
read2_hist.21725503.out
are the new ones without time limits

21725670      bgmp  sget.sh ladriani  R       0:01      1 n226
21725669      bgmp  sget.sh ladriani  R       0:17      1 n225
21725668      bgmp  sget.sh ladriani  R       0:40      1 n225
21725663      bgmp  sget.sh ladriani  R       1:07      1 n225

OKAY: HERE WE GO AGAIN! 
didn't change the read length argument in the file. had to add readlength.args for the init list functions. 



How many indexes have undetermined "N" base calls 

zcat 1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep -E "N" | wc 
3976613 3976613 35789517
zcat 1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '2~4p' | grep -E "N" | wc 
3328051 3328051 29952459


!! jason showed me  cat `/bin/ls get_hist.*out | tail -1` will give me the most recent output file !!!

Looked at the results for read 1 and read2 and they're looking good! compared to others in the class and the graphs have 
very similar dips and things!

Now going to work on Part 2 with pseudo code etc. 

Pseudo code looking good! Feeling good, went back and forth about including a dictionary or not, but I think what we did 
works just well.

Yesterday I created the unit tests from the first few lines of the 2017 data, adjusting the indexes to fit 8 different possibilites that my code is 
checking for: 

1. 1st index has an N 
2. 1st index does not have N but is not in the {known indexes}
3. Index 1 passes, index 2 has an N 
4. Index 1 passes, index 2 is not in the {known indexes}
5. They're both in the list but they don't match 
6. They match and they're in the list! 
7. Index 1 contains a q score under 30
8. Index 2 contains a q score under 30
